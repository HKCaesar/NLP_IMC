1175	Vaccination	PRO	"I understand scientism as a being kind of ideologically motivated pseudo science that goes beyond existing scientific evidence because of an a priori belief of what science should be able to do. In the case of vaccines, there is strong scientific evidence in their favor. 1/2"
1176	Vaccination	PRO	I say this as someone who has spent 8 years and quite a bit of her own money trying to develop vaccine infographics for ESL/ELL patients to combat antivaxx disinformation: I'll buy the potatoes if this is what it takes.  …
1177	Vaccination	PRO	In case the gravity of the danger posed by the anti-vaccine movement wasn't crystal clear... These fucking people will outright refuse to believe empirically confirmed science but will eagerly believe some random idiots on social media who tell them to feed their kids bleach.  …
1178	Vaccination	PRO	You do understand that “do your research” is exactly what qualified scientists have done for many years on “the shit” which is why we have vaccines against things like measles etc? Ill informed and dangerous views being spread here.
1179	Vaccination	PRO	"Have you ever had to look after an infant that developed a brain infection because their parents didn’t like vaccines? Tragically, this child will have permanent brain damage."
1180	Vaccination	PRO	A scientific study of the DTP vaccine found that it increased child death 1000%. If you are pro vaccine you are pro dead children. Another study found that flu vaccine increased fetal death 770% . If you are pro vaccine you are pro dead babies. #vaccines #MeaslesOutbreak #flu
1181	Vaccination	ANTI	"Fully vaxxed versus less vaxxed. How about a true vaxxed versus unvaxed study? Also, why is incidence of autism remarkably lower in Denmark? Probably just coincidence that they give half as many vaccines to their kids. Vaccines: so awesome that the government has 2 force them!"
1182	Vaccination	PRO	I wonder what these loony pro-plaguers would do if you offered them an autism vaccine... 
1183	Vaccination	PRO	I got atypical measles because I was vaccinated with the killed measles vaccine in the mid '60's. I was about 10 or 11 and I've never felt so ill. It came with pneumonia and a couple of months off school. Get your boosters.
1184	Vaccination	PRO	"Canada seems to take the problems of #homeopathy (here, wrongly using it as a vaccine alternative) more seriously than the UK regulators. Also the major UK homeopath societies hav come out against selling / offering 'homeopathic vaccines' and recommend actual vaccination.  …"

1188	Vaccination	ANTI	"Dr. Wakefield said the measles had become a mild disease in the US before they came out with the vaccine, but now a strain has developed that is resistant to the immunity produced by it and it is very dangerous, especially to babies and adults."

1197	Vaccination	ANTI	"RT Cernovich ""Mothers of vaccine-injured children are being silenced. No one is saying vaccines alone cause autism. Straw man! These moms have real stories. Who will tell them?"""
1198	Vaccination	PRO	Prove it. All recent research points to autism as being a developmental disorder & difference in brain structure that begins in the second trimester of pregnancy. You're wrong. Vaccines have nothing to do with autism.
1199	Vaccination	PRO	"“Anyone who wants to get the vaccine can get it though a simple call to 311,” mayor says."

1202	Vaccination	ANTI	Big Pharma is the Devil. Period. The Aluminum in the Flu vaccine causes Alzheimer's. They are VERY aware of this.
1203	Vaccination	PRO	"I know what you're all thinking, because I haven't been able to elicit a single crumb of concern for the children who are dying & being damaged for life by vaccine preventable diseases. In fact, several of your ilk have said they DO NOT CARE about the dead."

1210	Vaccination	ANTI	The flu virus always mutates so by the time a vaccine is available its already outdated
1212	Vaccination	PRO	"They rely on herd immunity, which means that enough people who can be vaccinated, are so that their risk of exposure is kept to a minimum. This is not an untested vaccine. It’s one that’s been around since we eradicated the disease almost two decades ago."
1214	Vaccination	PRO	No? A peer-reviewed clinical paper in a scientific journal showing that people are catching cancer or diptheria or polio from vaccines? Anything? A study showing an increase in Smallpox in areas of vaccination? There must be something for you to make such claims...
1215	Vaccination	PRO	"The #Meningococcal ACWY vaccine is your best protection against the deadly disease caused by four types of meningococcal bacteria - A, C, W and Y. Year 10 students can receive the #vaccine for free at school. "

1219	Vaccination	ANTI	"Considering majority of #measles cases in EU & US is in adults, it is disingenuous and manipulative to blame #antivaxxers not fulfilling their ""social responsibility"" in #vaccination. #vaccineswork is nonsense as Dr. Greg Poland confirmed #vaccine failures are becoming the issue "
1220	Vaccination	PRO	Fun fact: the doctor who did the “research” on vaccines causing autism ended up getting his title revoked because he tampered and altered his data.

The last 60 years of #vaccination, along with other environmental toxins that attack health, has led to us having a generation of the sickest kids ever. 50% of kids have one or more chronic illnesses. #vaccines"
1227	Vaccination	ANTI	"It blows my mind that deep+ warranted skepticism of BigPharma over the intentional poisoning of public health via the opioid crisis is viewed as legititmate, but skepticism of the SAME BigPharma over potential side-effects of powerful adjuvants in vaccines is seen as lunacy."
1228	Vaccination	PRO	"I make my real opinions known on Twitter. Vaccines don’t cause Autism, they keep autistic people alive long enough for people to notice they exist. Autistic folks had a nightmarishly short lifespan before modern western medicine came to the rescue."
1229	Vaccination	PRO	I’m pro vaccine but anti stopping speech.
1230	Vaccination	ANTI	Interestingly they have also banned the HPV vaccine in Japan.
