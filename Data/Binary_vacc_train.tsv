966	Vaccination	PRO	Early antiretroviral treatment may preserve key immune responses to HIV. Read our coverage of the new @ScienceTM publication from the Ragon Institute and colleagues to find out more about the implications for vaccine development. #HIV #AIDS #vaccine 
967	Vaccination	PRO	So you agree with Dr Zimmerman when he strongly recommends vaccines for all children?
968	Vaccination	PRO	We are fortunate that from the next academic year this vaccine will be offered to boys too #ThankYouLaura Thinking of your beautiful & brave wife Irene too @Stephenteap
969	Vaccination	ANTI	A link between aluminium in vaccines and autism? Interesting analysis here #vaxwoke #QAnon #antivaxx …
970	Vaccination	PRO	"To develop a vaccine for malaria, scientists need access to mosquitoes’ salivary glands, where the malaria-causing parasite is found. This painstaking work requires the procedure to be performed on each individual mosquito by hand."
971	Vaccination	PRO	"Where are you getting this from? I have 2 kids - 11 and 8 - and they've received 9 vaccines total, 10 if you include the flu shot each year. Most were under the age of 2, that is correct, but I have no idea where you're getting this 30+ number from."
972	Vaccination	ANTI	@DuckDuckGo Last straw. I was searching for what vaccine batches were contaminated (in News) and I got a page of fear-mongering lies about how 'deadly' measles is. You ARE the weakest link. Goodbye!
973	Vaccination	ANTI	"CDC: Cases of measles confirmed in 10 states | WLUK  Insert ""this vaccine states that it is a live virus and anyone injected with it can spread the virus for about 3 weeks""  #vaxxed #vaccineswork #ThinkBabies"

975	Vaccination	PRO	It's certainly not great to read about near-death experiences that could have been easily prevented .... and #science supports the safety of vaccines.  … via @nbcnews
978	Vaccination	PRO	"If I have to see one more Elmer's Glue Posse start speaking of how vaccines cause Autism, I'm gonna lose it. How do people NOT trust something that keeps you from dying, brain damage, or paralysis? How? How are people so fucking stupid?"
979	Vaccination	ANTI	More evidence of how too many vaccines harms mental development  …
980	Vaccination	PRO	1) There is zero scientific proof beyond the coincident that autism is first diagnosed at the same age most vaccines are given. Most likely cause is modern medicine allows far more people to survive childhood.
981	Vaccination	ANTI	If they are so safe why has 4 billion dollars been awarded to victims of vaccines?
982	Vaccination	PRO	"Why, yes as a matter of fact I have. a majority of the research shows that vaccines save lives more than it doesn't. These illnesses have killed millions of people, vaccines have saved those lives. I understand your viewpoint, but humankind is better off."
983	Vaccination	PRO	If ur smart enough to kno about “vaccine court” then ur probably smart enough to kno they deal w mostly cases of allergic reactions and few to none deaths a year.
984	Vaccination	ANTI	Those were the days when they received 1 vaccine. In America today kids will get 113 injections  … top Google search for 'the average American child receives how many vaccinations'. Just saying
986	Vaccination	PRO	She is talking about smesrs. The 1st HPV vaccine protects against strains for 70% of cervical cancers only and smears are recommended for all women. It's very sad for this young woman especially as attempts are being made to use her story to make people doubt #hpvvaccine
987	Vaccination	ANTI	"Sounds as smart as Richard Pan in California! (""the most dangerous thing in a vaccine is water"") I guess when you're speaking for industry, you can be as deceptive as industry."

991	Vaccination	ANTI	"Never underestimate the willful ignorance of the modern American. Iron lungs in a polio ward, 1950. BEFORE polio vaccines practically eradicated the disease. Society has a short memory. #vaccinate"
993	Vaccination	PRO	"Vaccine rash is not measles, not contagious, and does not come with the complications of measles. What is dangerous is measles that #vaccines prevent."
994	Vaccination	ANTI	"@HHSGov @CDCgov #HHSVaxChat Why don’t you look at genetically susceptible populations like many of our children & stop the mantra of vaccines being safe and effective for all? $4 billion paid out for injury, less than 1% reported. #IDoNotConsent"
995	Vaccination	ANTI	Merck Pharmaceuticals ground up my cervix and others gave it to all our young women called it a vaccine and that was after they had injected me with God knows what from Africa and it had begun to manifest illness in me.
998	Vaccination	PRO	Yes. An aggressive vaccine campaign would be an excellent thing in those places.
999	Vaccination	ANTI	Yes I know that also spikes in the age when Measles is acquired now too thanks to vaccines an illness that was a normal part of childhood is targeting adults now because they have an inferior vaccine that looses effectiveness instead of naturally acquired life long immunity 
1000	Vaccination	PRO	"Vaccines are rigorously tested and continuously monitored for safety and efficacy. Everyone wants safe vaccines. The CDC, FDA, ACIP question vaccine safety directly by examining actual data, not posting a list of stupid (yes stupid-thimerosal is not an adjuvant) questions."
1001	Vaccination	PRO	"On #worldimmunizationweek, we recognize the power of #vaccines in protecting effectively and safely against certain preventable illnesses. #Vaccines and the power to protect:  via @WHO"
1002	Vaccination	ANTI	Social contract? What are you talking about? I agree to nothing that has so much potential risk . Ever . My right to a healthy body cannot be infringed because you believe vaccines are magic.
1003	Vaccination	ANTI	Wish you cared about the vaccine injured kids this much! Your one good deed means shit when you put down other kids in ny!
