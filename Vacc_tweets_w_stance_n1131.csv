1188,Vaccination,ANTI,"Dr. Wakefield said the measles had become a mild disease in the US before they came out with the vaccine, but now a strain has developed that is resistant to the immunity produced by it and it is very dangerous, especially to babies and adults."
1189,Vaccination,UNKNOWN,"Angels haven't been disproven by science, neither has creationism, the 6K thing has been though. Vaccinations have also recently STOPPED working when they used to, & I haven't seen settled science for many of the new vaccines, but I generally support them.  …"

1194,Vaccination,PRO,"Up there with vaccine denial in quantifiable social harm. Hopefully there is a measured and full throated empirical rebuttal. Unfortunately, all it takes is one “expert” to convince folks who think the powers that be are nefarious."

1203,Vaccination,PRO,"I know what you're all thinking, because I haven't been able to elicit a single crumb of concern for the children who are dying & being damaged for life by vaccine preventable diseases. In fact, several of your ilk have said they DO NOT CARE about the dead."

1212,Vaccination,PRO,"They rely on herd immunity, which means that enough people who can be vaccinated, are so that their risk of exposure is kept to a minimum. This is not an untested vaccine. It’s one that’s been around since we eradicated the disease almost two decades ago."

1219,Vaccination,ANTI,"Considering majority of #measles cases in EU & US is in adults, it is disingenuous and manipulative to blame #antivaxxers not fulfilling their ""social responsibility"" in #vaccination. #vaccineswork is nonsense as Dr. Greg Poland confirmed #vaccine failures are becoming the issue "

1227,Vaccination,ANTI,"It blows my mind that deep+ warranted skepticism of BigPharma over the intentional poisoning of public health via the opioid crisis is viewed as legititmate, but skepticism of the SAME BigPharma over potential side-effects of powerful adjuvants in vaccines is seen as lunacy."
1228,Vaccination,PRO,"I make my real opinions known on Twitter. Vaccines don’t cause Autism, they keep autistic people alive long enough for people to notice they exist. Autistic folks had a nightmarishly short lifespan before modern western medicine came to the rescue."
